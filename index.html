        <h2>Answers to the Exam Paper</h2>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Question One</h3>
            <p>(a) The primary components of an organisation's working capital consist of current assets and current liabilities. Current assets encompass items such as inventories, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and prepaid expenses, which are anticipated to be converted into cash within one year. Current liabilities include trade payables, short-term borrowings, accrued expenses, and taxation payable, representing obligations due within one year.</p>
            <p>(b) Working capital is essential for financial sustainability as it ensures sufficient liquidity to cover short-term obligations and support ongoing operations. It functions as the operational "engine" of the business, facilitating the conversion of resources through the working capital cycle and preventing disruptions that could lead to insolvency. Effective management maintains stakeholder confidence, enables investment in growth opportunities, and mitigates risks from cash flow volatility.</p>
            <p>(c) Due to OCR limitations in the provided PDF, the financial statements for Richmond Retail Ltd. lack clear numerical values. To compute the working capital ratio (current ratio), apply the formula: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. For interpretation, a ratio exceeding 2:1 typically signifies strong liquidity, whereas a ratio below 1:1 indicates potential solvency risks. Assess this in context with industry norms and qualitative factors, such as seasonal variations or credit policies, to evaluate overall financial health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Question Two</h3>
            <p>(a) Ratio analysis involves deriving relationships between financial statement items to assess performance and position, offering insights beyond raw figures. From an analyst's perspective evaluating shares for investment, this approach is vital for determining value and risk. Key focus areas include profitability ratios (e.g., gross profit margin and return on capital employed) to gauge earnings efficiency, liquidity ratios (e.g., current and acid test) for short-term stability, and efficiency ratios (e.g., inventory turnover) for operational effectiveness. This enables comparisons with benchmarks, trend analysis, and informed decisions on investment viability.</p>
            <p>(b) The financial statements for Palmer Plastics Ltd. are incomplete in the OCR output. To conduct the analysis, calculate ratios as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit ÷ Sales Revenue) × 100%</li>
                <li>Net Profit Margin = (Net Profit ÷ Sales Revenue) × 100%</li>
                <li>Return on Capital Employed = (Operating Profit ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)) × 100%</li>
                <li>Current Ratio = Current Assets : Current Liabilities</li>
                <li>Acid Test Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories) : Current Liabilities</li>
                <li>Inventory Turnover Period = (Average Inventories ÷ Cost of Sales) × 365 days</li>
                <li>Receivables Settlement Period = (Trade Receivables ÷ Sales Revenue) × 365 days</li>
                <li>Payables Settlement Period = (Trade Payables ÷ Cost of Sales) × 365 days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Interpretations should highlight strengths (e.g., high margins indicating cost control) and weaknesses (e.g., low liquidity suggesting cash constraints), with recommendations for improvements like enhanced credit management.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Question Three</h3>
            <p>(a) The Statement of Cash Flows is a critical document as it delineates cash movements across operating, investing, and financing activities, providing transparency on actual liquidity that accrual-based statements may obscure. Users rely on it to evaluate cash generation capacity, solvency, and financial flexibility, informing decisions such as investments, lending, or strategic planning.</p>
            <p>(b) From an internal management standpoint, daily cash balance monitoring is imperative to safeguard liquidity, avert overdrafts, and enable prompt responses to variances. It supports accurate budgeting, cost minimization, and operational adjustments.</p>
            <p>(c) To secure cash for stakeholders during low-activity periods, implement strategies including expediting receivables collection via discounts, extending supplier terms, curtailing non-essential costs, and establishing contingency reserves.</p>
            <p>(d) Management options for cash surpluses encompass investing in interest-bearing instruments, debt repayment, dividend payouts, share repurchases, or allocating funds to capital projects for expansion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Question Four</h3>
            <p>(a) Principal sources of long-term capital in a large organization comprise equity shares, retained earnings, long-term debt such as bonds, and hybrid options like convertible instruments.</p>
            <p>(b) Issuing additional share capital provides advantages including no fixed repayment or interest burdens and bolstered solvency. Disadvantages involve ownership dilution, heightened dividend pressures, and reliance on favorable market conditions.</p>
            <p>(c) A bank overdraft constitutes a flexible short-term credit facility permitting account overdrafts up to a predefined limit. Advantages include immediate liquidity for cash shortfalls with interest solely on utilized funds. Disadvantages include elevated interest charges, risk of facility revocation, and implications for perceived financial stability.</p>
            <p>(d) Debt factoring enhances working capital by liquidating receivables for upfront cash, thereby accelerating inflows, alleviating collection burdens, and improving liquidity without incurring further debt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Question Five</h3>
            <p>(a) OCR data for Blanch Plant plc is ambiguous (e.g., potential figures like €100 selling price per unit). To prepare a marginal costing profit and loss account: Determine units sold = Opening Inventory + Units Produced - Closing Inventory. Compute sales revenue = Units Sold × Selling Price. Variable costs = Units Sold × Variable Cost per Unit. Contribution = Revenue - Variable Costs. Net Profit = Contribution - Fixed Costs (production + general overheads). Break-even units = Fixed Costs ÷ (Selling Price - Variable Cost per Unit). Break-even value = Break-even Units × Selling Price.</p>
            <p>(b) Marginal costing aids in isolating variable costs for pricing and profitability decisions, contrasting with absorption costing by treating fixed costs as period expenses.</p>
            <p>(c) Break-even analysis identifies the sales threshold for covering costs, useful for scenario planning, budgeting, and evaluating operational changes.</p>
